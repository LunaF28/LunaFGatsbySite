I chose these main themes of <strong>Urban Despair/Horror</strong> mixed with <strong>Obsession</strong> because I have always wanted to write a horror esque story in a very vague tone. The story, <em>Love</em>, is told from the perspective of a salesman wandering around \"The City.\" He sees a woman on the side of the road and well... The rest is in the story below.</p>\n<h2>Love</h2>\n<p>“Wares! New wares!” He calls out, ringing that familiar bell as he walks down the soot-caked and smog-filled side street. People call him “The Wandering Merchant,” “The Lost One,” “That Homeless Guy,” and many more names, but none of those are fully true. He is simply a man who wants to help people on their path to finding purpose, and he couldn’t do that as a cook, or an office worker, or anything official in The City. He got where he is today by finding, buying, and stealing what he has. He keeps it all in a cart he built himself, just as he made the clothes he wears and the shoes he wears and the house he lives in. He only keeps exactly what he needs, and gives everything extra that he has to others like him, but who aren’t as fortunate. People who wander, but without an aim. People who live, but without purpose. People who survive, but without any desire.</p>\n<p>As he wanders down the street, ringing his bell and calling out about his wares, he sees a shivering woman on the edge of the street. This woman… There’s just something about her. He knows that she is the one. He imagines him and her, out of The City, down by a river. Sitting on a blanket, having a picnic, as deep in love as two people can be. Maybe they’d have a kid and that kid would take over his role in The City, helping those who need it most. Their life will be beautiful. He knows that she is the one. Her tattered sweatpants tell the story of someone in need. Her sole golden earring in the shape of a snake with a cracked false ruby in the eye tells the story of someone used. The wrinkles above her young eyes tell the story of someone who has spent her life in constant stress. He absorbs her essence, knowing how much he cares for her. She is the only thing he has ever—a church bell clangs loudly, drowning out his thoughts. He only ever helps people who ask him to, but this woman, she’s so beautiful. He shouldn’t go to her, he should do what he always does, he should continue his life as he always has. But he can’t. He releases his cart and allows it to roll away. It slams into a trashcan and with a crash both fall over, mixing his wares with the trash of apartment 302.</p>\n<p>He walks over to her, hearing and seeing nothing of his belongings for he is drowning in her aura. He sets himself down next to her, gazing into that cracked ruby, wondering if it means more than what he sees. He knows that she is the one. He looks her in the eyes and opens his mouth to tell her his dreams for them, but she stops him. He must obey her command, it is paramount to his directive of love. She says that she just wants to die. Nothing more. Nothing. More. The City has taken everything from her. She’s done. He opens his mouth again to tell her his dreams for the two of them, and then he pauses. He must obey her command, but he can never have love if she’s gone. He turns to her. He looks at her with gleaming eyes, infatuated. “Are you sure?” “Yes.” He must obey her command. This is love. A bright kitchen light from a second floor apartment gleams on something in his hand. She slumps over, her eyes still open. As he begins to remove her frayed black jacket, not bothering to check its pockets, he doesn’t see the blood pouring from her head or the fact that her frayed black jacket is caught on a nail protruding from the wall. All he sees is a life he could have had.</p>\n<h2>Afterword</h2>\n<p>This story originally focused more on the background of \"The City\" and less on the faux relationship between the man and the woman, but upon editing the story him killing her made no sense. I then chose to cut down on the outside description and focus deeply into the mind of the man. I wanted to make sure you could deeply understand these things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>His wants in this moment.</li>\n<li>His instant obsession.</li>\n<li>His attitude as a person.</li>\n<li>His fixation on \"saving\" people.</li>\n<li>How The City has shaped him and those around him.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With those things in focus, the rest of my edits were spent refining those things. The short dialogue between the two characters was one of the last things I added to this story. In one of my last few re-reads, a classmate of mine felt that the woman was too sidelined in this story, and I felt that adding a little dialogue between her and the man both <strong>deepens</strong> the reader's understanding of the man, while also <strong>making the woman a true character</strong> and less of a background item. It was a difficult task adding more of her to the story, because she was meant to be so unimportant to the man while also an obession of his. The dialogue balances the two things perfectly, because the story remains entirely focused on the man while still giving her something to say.</p>\n<h2>Table of Key Themes</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Theme</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Description</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Obsession</strong></td>\n<td>The man's fixation on the woman and his distorted view of love and purpose.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Urban Despair</strong></td>\n<td>The harsh, oppressive environment of \"The City\" that shapes the characters' lives.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Delusion</strong></td>\n<td>The protagonist's inability to see reality clearly, leading to tragic decisions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faux\"><strong>Faux</strong></a> <strong>Love</strong></td>\n<td>The relationship between the man and woman is one-sided and based on insane fantasy.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Isolation</strong></td>\n<td>Both characters are isolated, but in different ways, with the man being known by everyone but truly known by no one, and the woman being left with truly no one on the side of the road to die.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Short Story","date":"November 15, 2024","description":"A short story I wrote for an essay writing class."}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/graphic-design/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Graphic Design"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"17e45209-82b4-5f95-a70d-9c3b5043df92","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"b20ad89a-e8a4-5bad-a9f4-f42c65e371c6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3274528899"],"slicesMap":{}}
